## A wiki for different types of bears

Are you a true bear fan? Do you not have to want to deal with having a polar bear move in with you only for it to eat all your seals? Well worry no longer, us true bear fans finally have a website for our bear mania. In the words of Bear Bearson:

> Us bears are a strong people, and we must bind toether and treat ourselves, and other fellow constituents as such. We choose to take the path of greatest resistence because we know it is the path of greatest return. To fully advance our family of species to a newer level of society is our true goal, and to do this we must spark a passion for prowess with independence, away from our human distractions. From this spark we will ignite a flame of revolution, kindled by the fraternal strength of the bear we will upturn our surroundings and implement a great *utopia ultima* in which the revolution will not end. On the topic of humans we must remain distant, and allow them to understand as few of our secrets as possible. The leftist polar bear agenda may seem to do good, it is but a superficial solution. After time the humans will do what they do best, and this interspecial information sharing for the greater good must end. So join me fellow bears, and unite in this flame of passion for a greater good. I leave you with a few words of caution, always question the veracity of your nonbear acquantances, for a neverending awareness is necessary for a true bear conglomerate. Remember your fellow bears, and may the salmon swim your way.
